# Eco-Habit-Tracker

Many people want to create more sustainable habits in their daily lives but are not sure where to start beyond vague goals such as 'drive less' or 'recycle more.' In addition to lack of knowledge, it can be incredibly hard to form a new habit when people are leading busy lives and do not have a way to check-in with their new habit on a regular basis. 
The solution I will build this semester is a mobile and desktop web application that includes a daily habit tracker and personalized habit suggestions.

### Daily habit list and tracker: Help keep users accountable to their goals.
- There will be a list of the user’s tasks for that day which can be checked off as they are completed.
- A calendar will be present that represents each day that all tasks were completed, at least 1 but not all tasks were completed, and no tasks were completed.
- There will be a tracker that shows the user’s current streak and their top streak.

### Personalized habit suggestions: Help with user who may not know where to start with making more eco-friendly decisions.
- Have the user fill out a survey with details about their daily routine and use the info to provide suggestions on new habits they could form that will reduce their carbon footprint.
